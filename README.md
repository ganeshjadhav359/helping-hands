# helping-hands

Motivation behind project :
To create a platform for NGOs and people who wanted to give help to
get into contact with the helpseekers.

Abstract :
This is the first project I have build with other two guys. The aim is
establish a bridge between NGOs to come in contact with the people
they can help and helpseekers...
we have created client server based web application.
We have tried to build web application so that if anybody want help then he or she can post about it via this platform.
Then this post goes to all people who are intrested to help for a particular domain.
Those can contact to her or him.
